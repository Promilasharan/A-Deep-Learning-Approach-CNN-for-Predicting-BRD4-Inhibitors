# A-Deep-Learning-Approach-CNN-for-Predicting-BRD4-Inhibitors
This repository contains a deep learning project focused on predicting inhibitors of the Bromo-domain containing 4 inhibitor (BRD4) protein using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  BRD4 is a key epigenetic regulator and identifying potential inhibitors can have significant implications in drug discovery and medical research.
